## 1999.03
I was born in an ordinary small village in Dancheng County, Zhoukou City, Henan Province.

That year, when I was three, my parents decided to continue working away from home. From that point on, it was just my grandmother and me, depending on each other for a prolonged period.

That year, I turned four and entered the local elementary school, "Sanli Elementary School," joining the mid-year grade.Starting my student journey at a younger age than my classmates around me.

My seven years of primary school were the happiest moments of my childhood. My friends and I walked 2 kilometers to and from school every day, crossing the fields, leaving our footprints on every passable path.  
During the busy farming season, it was common to see an old and a young figure in the village. The elder pulled a rural, unique two-wheeled cart filled with high piles of the stalks, a rope extended from the front of the cart, and at the other end of the rope was a young boy bent over, exerting all his strength. It was this tough period that exposed me to the hardships of life at a very young age, cultivating a character of integrity and perseverance. Later on, people who got to know me were often puzzled by one thing: Why hadn't I turned into an unruly troublemaker without parental discipline and guidance during my childhood? And how did I manage to maintain relatively good academic performance? I have always been clear about the answer to this question, because I knew from that time on, that it's essential to strive hard.

That year, I was 11. While most of my childhood friends chose to attend better junior high schools in the county, I still decided to stay in the local town school. Even though it was just a small junior high school in a tiny town, the new environment and boarding lifestyle made me feel extremely uneasy and confined.

When I was 14, I successfully entered the Second Senior High School of Dancheng County. Looking back at my high school years, it was a journey of continuous upward progression through my efforts. At that time, the high school classified classes based on academic performance. When I first entered high school, I was placed in the lowest-performing class of the entire freshman year. Through hard work, by the end of my freshman year when students were separated into arts and sciences streams, I moved up to a slightly better transitional class. As I progressed from the first to the second year of high school, I was placed in the school's key class. Moving from the second to the third year, I entered the school's top Honors class. And during the college entrance examination, I achieved my best results since joining this class, catching everyone by surprise.

At the age of 17, I was admitted to the School of Art and Design at Henan University of Technology, majoring in Industrial Design. From then on, the calculator in my hand was replaced by a 2B pencil. Everything started anew, beginning with every single line, marking the commencement of my new academic journey.

When I turned 20, after weighing various factors, I decided to take the postgraduate entrance examination. In the first year, I set my sights high and applied to Zhejiang University of Technology. Unfortunately, it ended in failure.
