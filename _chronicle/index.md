## 1999.03
I was born in an ordinary small village in Dancheng County, Zhoukou City, Henan Province.
## 2002.xx
That year, when I was **3**, my parents decided to continue working away from home. From that point on, it was just my grandmother and me, depending on each other for a prolonged period.
## 2003.06
That year, I turned **4** and entered the local elementary school, "Sanli Elementary School," joining the mid-year grade.Starting my student journey at a younger age than my classmates around me.
## 2003.06-2010.06
My seven years of primary school were the happiest moments of my childhood. My friends and I walked 2 kilometers to and from school every day, crossing the fields, leaving our footprints on every passable path.  

During the busy farming season, it was common to see an old and a young figure in the village. The elder pulled a rural, unique two-wheeled cart filled with high piles of the stalks, a rope extended from the front of the cart, and at the other end of the rope was a young boy bent over, exerting all his strength. It was this tough period that exposed me to the hardships of life at a very young age, cultivating a character of integrity and perseverance.  
> Later on, people who got to know me were often puzzled by one thing: **Why hadn't I turned into an unruly troublemaker without parental discipline and guidance during my childhood? And how did I manage to maintain relatively good academic performance?** I have always been clear about the answer to this question, because I knew from that time on, that it's essential to strive hard.

## 2010.07
That year, I was **11**. While most of my childhood friends chose to attend better junior high schools in the county, I still decided to stay in the local town school. Even though it was just a small junior high school in a tiny town, the new environment and boarding lifestyle made me feel extremely uneasy and confined.
## 2013.07
When I was **14**, I successfully entered the Second Senior High School of Dancheng County. Looking back at my high school years, it was a journey of continuous upward progression through my efforts:  
*At that time, the high school classified classes based on academic performance.*  
- When I first entered high school, I was placed in the **lowest-performing class** of the entire freshman year.
- Through hard work, by the end of my freshman year when students were separated into arts and sciences streams, I moved up to a slightly better **Foundation Class**.
- As I progressed from the first to the second year of high school, I was placed in the school's **Key Focus Class**.
- Moving from the second to the third year, I entered the school's **High Ambition Class**.  

And during the college entrance examination, I achieved my best results since joining this class, catching everyone by surprise.

At the age of **17**, I was admitted to the School of Art and Design at *Henan University of Technology*, majoring in Industrial Design. From then on, the calculator in my hand was replaced by a 2B pencil. Everything started anew, beginning with every single line, marking the commencement of my new academic journey.
## 2019.06
When I turned **20**, after weighing various factors, I decided to take the *postgraduate entrance examination*. In the first year, I set my sights high and applied to Zhejiang University of Technology. Unfortunately, it ended in failure.
## 2020.06
At **21**, the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic abruptly ended our graduation ceremony. We were thrust into society unexpectedly.   
> After some drifting, I chose to take the military civil service examination. I managed to achieve the highest score in the written test, which led to the interview stage. Then, I embarked on a journey from my hometown, spending over twenty hours on a hard-seat train to Guangzhou for the interview. To my surprise, out of the five interviewees, I was the only recent college graduate. Young and without any interview experience, I eventually ranked second in the overall score and missed the cut.   
After careful consideration, I decided to pursue further studies and prepare for *postgraduate entrance exams*.  

After my initial setback, my primary goal for the year was to secure a spot in graduate school. I chose to return to my family's new house in my hometown to prepare for the postgraduate examination alone. As time went on, I realized that this learning environment, isolated at home, suited me better. My study efficiency was notably higher than during my first year of preparation. Thus, I spent my days in solitude, memorizing, solving problems, and practicing hand-drawing. After several months of hard work, I successfully got admitted to Zhengzhou University of Light Industry. Throughout both postgraduate exam preparations, I never enrolled in any hand-drawing tutoring classes. The only companions I had were hand-drawing guidebooks from various institutions.
## 2021.09
At **22**, I successfully entered the School of Art and Design at Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, becoming a master's student.
## 2022.07
At **23**, those friends of mine who didn't choose postgraduate studies were already settling down â€” some got married, while others started their careers. They all seemed to have established a stable life. This situation added pressure on my considerations for the future. After profound discussions with my girlfriend, with whom I've been for seven years, and weighing our future plans along with my personal circumstances, I resolutely decided to pursue a doctoral degree.

This year has truly been a hectic one.
