# Hello ！ 
I'm a 24-year-old master's student from the College of Art and Design at Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, currently in my third year.   
> As I stand at this crucial juncture in life, I've resolutely chosen to deepen my academic pursuits by seeking a doctoral degree.Despite understanding the challenges and pressures of a doctoral degree, and knowing the monotony and repetition of research that can deter many, *I remain resolute in my pursuit of a PhD. This decision stems from deep reflection.*

Why choose to pursue a doctorate?
======
In my second year of graduate studies, I pondered the paths I might take after graduation. Like many of my peers, I had three options: becoming a designer, joining the civil service, or pursuing a doctoral degree. Assessing my strengths and interests, I chose the academic route, believing it aligns best with who I am.

1. **Personality**.Raised in the countryside, I am the quintessential "left-behind child." My formative years were spent alongside my grandmother, tending to our family's few acres of land. This early immersion in agricultural duties allowed me to grasp the hardships of life at a tender age, shaping a resilient and steadfast spirit within me. Growing up without siblings, I found solace in my own company, nurturing a natural inclination for solitude. These experiences have made me well-suited for the methodical rhythm of scientific research. In essence, my very character draws me to the world of research.

2. **Ability**.From my early days, the environment I was raised in instilled in me a penchant for deep, independent exploration, fostering robust self-learning skills.Transitioning from a science background to the vibrant realm of design in college was a leap — from mathematical equations to expressive hand sketches. Yet, I navigated this transformation seamlessly, leaning into my inherent adaptability. Throughout my undergraduate journey and as I prepared for postgraduate exams, I never sought specialized drawing tutorials. Armed only with sketching manuals and relentless practice, I earned my place as a master's student in art and design. Notably, I was the lone student in my batch with a science background and without formal drawing class training. It's this innate ability to learn and adapt that fuels my confidence to embrace a research-oriented life.

3. **Long-Term Vision**.To me, the decision to pursue a doctoral degree is not merely an academic choice, but one that is deeply intertwined with my long-term professional and personal objectives.First and foremost, I believe that doctoral research will equip me with in-depth, specialized knowledge, crucial for establishing a core competency in my chosen field. Throughout this journey, I intend to collaborate closely with my advisors and lab mates to ensure that my research aligns with industry trends and demands. This alignment will not only provide me with practical work experience but also help me forge a robust professional network. In the long run, I plan to continually update and broaden my expertise, ensuring I remain at the forefront of my discipline. Moreover, I aspire to have the opportunity to educate and mentor the next generation of researchers, sharing with them my insights and experiences.This is a clear blueprint for my future. I'm confident that by undertaking a Ph.D., I'm laying a solid foundation to achieve these objectives.

Sharing my experiences,my purpose is twofold. First, to highlight the deep-seated motivations that steer me towards a doctorate. And second, to extend a sincere promise to the professors:

> **If chosen, I may not be the best, but I'll certainly be the most hardworking one.**  
> Please believe that I am not lacking in the effort to embrace success. What I lack is a better platform and resources.Therefore, I am committed to advancing further in academia, hoping to do so under your esteemed guidance.
