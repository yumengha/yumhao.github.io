- Within the [Hobbies](https://yumengha.github.io/yumhao.github.io//hobbies/) section, I present my longstanding dedication to physical fitness.

Research Interests
------
I am focused on user-centered design methods and applications, such as Kansei Engineering, Neural Networks, and related technical means. I am equally interested in the exploration and innovation of these design methods. Additionally, I am very intrigued by the design opportunities brought about by the development of innovative technologies like AIGC.My primary research interests are as follows:

1. Computer-Aided Design
2. Human-Computer Intelligent Interaction
3. Design Methods and Strategies
4. User Research
