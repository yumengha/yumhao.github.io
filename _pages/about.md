# Hello ！ 
I am a 24-year-old master's student from the College of Art and Design at Zhengzhou University of Light Industry.I am now in my third year of postgraduate studies. Facing the impending crossroads in my life, I have firmly chosen to continue my academic journey. I've decided to become a researcher, to pursue a doctorate, and to delve deeper into my field of expertise. In reality, the challenges of becoming a doctorate holder and successfully obtaining a PhD might deter some. Furthermore, the monotony and tediousness of academic research can make some feel overwhelmed. Yet, facing these potential challenges and trials, my decision to pursue a doctoral degree is the result of careful and thorough consideration.

Why choose to pursue a doctorate?
======
During my second year of graduate studies, I reflected on the possible life choices I might face after graduation. Like many others, I had three options. The first was to work in a field related to my major, essentially becoming a designer.The second was to take the civil service exam and join the government system. The third was to continue pursuing a doctorate. Among these three options, considering my unique strengths and characteristics, I chose the third path, which I believe is the most suitable for me.

1. **Personality**.I am a genuine child raised in the countryside and a typical "left-behind child." Growing up, I lived with my grandmother, managing and working on the few acres of land our family owned. The laborious and busy agricultural life made me recognize the hardships of life from a young age, and it also cultivated in me a tenacious and steady character.At the same time, having no siblings, I grew accustomed during my childhood to finding joy on my own, gradually developing a preference for solitude in my approach to life.All these factors enable me to adapt well to the monotonous life of scientific research. It could be said that due to my personality, I prefer to become a researcher.

2. **Ability**.Due to my upbringing, I enjoy delving deeply into subjects on my own,which has endowed me with strong self-learning capabilities.In college, I entered the entirely new world of design as a student with a science background. The content of my studies shifted from mathematical formulas to hand drawings.Despite this drastic change, I quickly adapted to the transition relying on my own abilities. Throughout my undergraduate years, including my postgraduate entrance exam preparations,I have never enrolled in any hand-drawing tutoring classes.With just a few sketching guidebooks and extensive practice, I successfully became a master's student in art and design. Eventually, I was the only student in my cohort with a science background and who did not come from a dedicated drawing class.It can be said that my strong learning ability has given me the confidence to choose and face a life in research.

From sharing about my upbringing and my postgraduate entrance exam experience, on one hand, I aim to explain the reasons for my choice to pursue a doctorate based on my personal circumstances. On the other hand, I also wish to demonstrate something to the professors:

**If you choose me, although I may not be the best, I will certainly be the most hardworking one.**
Please believe that I am not lacking in the effort to embrace success. What I lack is a better platform and resources.Hence, I've chosen to continue my climb on the academic path, and I choose to become your student and pursue further studies.


As for why I say this, I hope to continue showing you a sincere and hardworking side of me, but this might take some of your time:

If you wish to understand me more deeply, you can refer to the [Growth Diary] section.
Additionally, after deciding that I wanted to pursue a doctorate, the efforts I've made towards this goal can be seen in the [publications](https://yumengha.github.io/yumhao.github.io//publications/) section.

Research Interests
------
I am focused on user-centered design methods and applications, such as Kansei Engineering, Neural Networks, and related technical means. I am equally interested in the exploration and innovation of these design methods. Additionally, I am very intrigued by the design opportunities brought about by the development of innovative technologies like AIGC.My primary research interests are as follows:

1. User Research
2. Design Methods and Strategies
3. Computer-Aided Design
4. Artificial Intelligence
