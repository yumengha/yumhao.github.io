## "Abacus" Night Light
The inspiration for this design comes from the form of the traditional Chinese counting tool, the "abacus". The brightness of the light can be adjusted by sliding the beads left and right.

The light fixture is primarily divided into two parts, left and right, connected by an arch structure in the middle. This design allows the beads on both sides to slide, adjusting the brightness of the light based on the number of beads on the left side.

In terms of details, starting with the design of the beads, their overall shape is more rounded, resembling a full "persimmon". The smooth shape not only imparts a warm and gentle feeling, complementing the ambiance of the light fixture, but the overall design of the fixture also resembles a handheld fruit basket. The full persimmon shape evokes a sense of abundance and a warm atmosphere.
