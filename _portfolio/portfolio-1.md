In terms of details, starting with the design of the beads, their overall shape is more rounded, resembling a full "persimmon". The smooth shape not only imparts a warm and gentle feeling, complementing the ambiance of the light fixture, but the overall design of the fixture also resembles a handheld fruit basket. The full persimmon shape evokes a sense of abundance and a warm atmosphere.

## "LOVE" Side Table
The design is inspired by the traditional Chinese poem which states, "In the sky, I wish to be birds flying side by side; on earth, I wish to be branches intertwined." In terms of design, the upper tabletop adopts the form of birds flying side by side, while the lower support is designed in the style of intertwined branches. The design of the top and bottom parts corresponds with the poetic sentiment. The overall shape and design is simple and intuitive, symbolizing people's unwavering love, evoking deep and passionate emotional responses.
