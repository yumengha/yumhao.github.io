**Abstract:** **Objective** To build a multi-channel human-computer interaction model for takeaway helmets to improve the 
intelligence of takeaway helmets and the naturalness of human-computer interaction for the work characteristics of delivery service of riders in the take-away industry. **Methods** Combining the delivery service process of the take-out industry 
and the related user behavior relationship, the behavior of the take-out riders in the four links of receiving orders, going to 
pick up, riding to deliver and dispatching orders when delivering orders is analyzed, and the potential behavioral characteristics are summarized, and finally the relevant behavior of the take-out riders corresponds to their physiological channels through the method of classification and comparison, and the multi-channel interaction mode of the take-out helmet is 
obtained after screening and summarizing. **Results** According to the results of user behavior analysis and the multi-channel interaction mode of the takeaway helmet, a multi-channel human-computer interaction model of the takeaway 
helmet is constructed. **Conclusion** The construction of multi-channel human-computer interaction model forms a set of 
natural and efficient information flow model, which can well meet the multi-channel interaction needs of delivery riders in 
the delivery process, providing a multi-channel interaction design method for delivery helmets and providing new ideas 
and references for the development of intelligent design of takeaway helmets.
