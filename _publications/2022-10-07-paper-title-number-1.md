**Abstract:** Objective Exploring the application of artificial neural networks in the field of smart home products based on 
perceptual engineering theory. Methods Using air purifiers as the research objects, a wide range of representative air purifier styling image samples and perceptual vocabulary were collected, and the mean value of users' perceptual evaluation of air purifier styling was counted using semantic difference method and dimensionality reduction was applied using 
principal component analysis. The significant design elements of the air purifier shape were extracted based on morphological analysis, and the relative weights of each design element were calculated using hierarchical analysis. The BP neural network model was trained using the sample design element weight codes as the input layer and the users' perceptual 
evaluation averages as the output layer. Results The validity of the prediction model was verified using the leave-one-out 
cross-validation method and case evaluation for the trained BP neural network model. Conclusion The prediction model 
can effectively solve the matching problem between design elements and perceptual imagery at the preliminary stage of 
product development, assisting designers to make appropriate design decisions and providing useful reference and guidance for pioneering innovation in the field of smart home product design.

## The Story Behind the Research: A Personal Note
This paper was written following the completion of a [previous article](https://yumengha.github.io/yumhao.github.io//publication/2022-10-08-paper-title-number-2). While working on the last paper, the keyword "neural network" frequently appeared in the related literature. Therefore, when choosing a new topic, I decided to focus on this widely applied technique within the realm of Kansei Engineering. Similar to before, it was essential to understand its concept and application methods. The method of application in the initial preparation was similar to the Quantification Theory Type I. During this period, the main focus was on learning the principles of Artificial Neural Networks, including its three-layer structure, training methods, and the learning platform Matlab, encompassing code principles and parameter settings, among other aspects. Ultimately, the acquired knowledge was successfully applied in this article.
