**Abstract:** Objective To explore the mapping relationship between the user's perceptual imagery and the design elements 
of the rear of the car based on the theory of perceptual engineering. Methods Collect and screen representative car tail 
styling image samples and related perceptual vocabulary, create a questionnaire using semantic difference method, count 
the mean value of users' perceptual evaluation of car tail styling, extract significant design elements of car tail styling using morphological analysis, build a response matrix of design elements based on quantitative theory Ⅰ, and construct a prediction model between perceptual imagery and car tail design elements using multiple linear regression analysis. Results Reorganization of design elements based on the results of linear regression analysis, and the validity of the predic￾tive model was demonstrated by case evaluation. Conclusion Different rear design elements have different degrees of in￾fluence on the user's perceptual imagery, and the design method based on perceptual engineering can better meet the user's 
perceptual needs and effectively provide an objective decision basis for the design of the rear of the car.
