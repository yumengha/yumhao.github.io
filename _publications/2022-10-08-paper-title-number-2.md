**Abstract:** Objective To explore the mapping relationship between the user's perceptual imagery and the design elements 
of the rear of the car based on the theory of perceptual engineering. Methods Collect and screen representative car tail 
styling image samples and related perceptual vocabulary, create a questionnaire using semantic difference method, count 
the mean value of users' perceptual evaluation of car tail styling, extract significant design elements of car tail styling using morphological analysis, build a response matrix of design elements based on quantitative theory Ⅰ, and construct a prediction model between perceptual imagery and car tail design elements using multiple linear regression analysis. Results Reorganization of design elements based on the results of linear regression analysis, and the validity of the predictive model was demonstrated by case evaluation. Conclusion Different rear design elements have different degrees of influence on the user's perceptual imagery, and the design method based on perceptual engineering can better meet the user's 
perceptual needs and effectively provide an objective decision basis for the design of the rear of the car.  
**Keywords:** Kansei Engineering; Perceptual imagery; Car rear; Styling Design; quantification theory Ⅰ

## The Story Behind the Research: A Personal Note
This article might be considered one of my proudest works from the earlier phase of my academic journey, consuming the most time and effort. It was during the process of writing this paper that I was introduced to the field of Kansei Engineering. The first time I encountered an article related to Kansei Engineering, I found the approach fascinating, especially because the literature incorporated numerous formulas and computations. On one hand, I genuinely enjoyed this scientific and rational process of design evolution; on the other, my experience suggested that academic papers involving extensive calculations were more likely to be favored by relevant journals. Hence, I spent a great deal of time reading papers related to Kansei Engineering. I began by understanding the foundational theories and meaning of Kansei Engineering, and then proceeded to explore the technical methods available in its research realm, including Quantification Theory, Linear Regression Analysis, Neural Networks, and more. Through my studies, I realized that there wasn't a fixed methodology based on the theory of Kansei Engineering, indicating that there were more possibilities for research in the related fields. Consequently, for an extended period, my focus remained steadfastly on research related to Kansei Engineering. Upon selecting the topic for this paper, my readings indicated that the application of Kansei Engineering in car design was most prevalent. Extensive research had been conducted on various parts of the car, such as the front face, grille, sides, and center console. However, I didn't come across any study specifically focusing on the design of the rear part of a car. I believed that I had pinpointed an innovative research angle. I invested significant energy in research preparation, which included sample collection, processing, online questionnaire dissemination, and more. I also taught myself how to use SPSS for data analysis, covering techniques like Linear Regression, Questionnaire Analysis, and Partial Correlation Analysis. After extensive learning and relentless effort, I finally completed this paper.
