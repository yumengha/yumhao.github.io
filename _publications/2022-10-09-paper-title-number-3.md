**Abstract:** With the growth of new energy vehicles, competition in the auto industry is fierce.
Automotive brands must continuously seek innovative design solutions to secure their market 
position. Which BEVs offer more design freedom, particularly in interior design, as they don't 
require considerations for fuel engines and related components. However, with the arrival of 
the era of personalized consumption, what kind of design exploration can be accepted by 
consumers is still under study. Therefore, this research uses Kansei engineering theory to study 
the center console of BEVs, collect and select representative images sample and perceptual 
vocabulary of BEV center console, counts the mean value of users’ perceptual evaluation 
through market research, establishes the response matrix of design elements based on 
quantitative theory Ⅰ, and uses multiple linear regression analysis to obtain the influence 
relationship between each design element and users’ perceptual imagery, so as to evaluate 
innovative design results of the BEV center console. The research results indicate that different 
center console design elements have a significant difference in the degree of influence on user 
sensory imagery. The connection transition method between the center console and armrest box 
has a significant impact on the user’s perception of the simplicity. The usage method of the 
center screen and the color matching will have a significant impact on its futuristic

## The Story Behind the Research: A Personal Note
This article was written in the format of an international conference paper, marking my first attempt at composing an English manuscript. At that time, I was eager to write a high-quality SCI paper, but given the lack of resources and opportunities, I felt that achieving an SCI publication seemed far-fetched, even unattainable. However, I wasn't ready to give up. I believed that I had to try, even if the endeavor was destined to fail, as the process itself would be an invaluable learning experience for me. After careful consideration, I decided on a step-by-step approach, setting my initial goal on the relatively more accessible international conference papers. This would give me a chance to practice English academic writing and familiarize myself with the format. The preliminary work involved selecting an appropriate international conference. During this period, I extensively searched for related conferences on websites like IEEE, ConferenceAlert, AiScholar, and China Academic Conference Online. However, I found the sheer number of related conferences overwhelming, and the varied quality made it difficult to discern the best choice. Eventually, I took the most convenient route and chose to submit via Aisi Blue. The paper was accepted without the need for revisions. However, months after participating in the online conference, I was informed that I had to resubmit to another event. This wasted a considerable amount of my time, and I chose to withdraw the paper. Due to time constraints, this work, into which I had poured so much effort, was temporarily shelved.
