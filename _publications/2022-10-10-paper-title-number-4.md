excerpt: 'This paper is actually the second to last article I have written so far. It is also the first time I have attempted to write an article with the goal of being included in the SCI. This bold attempt was made after I had written a considerable number of papers on Kansei Engineering and Neural Networks, and I believed that I had a certain mastery of the relevant knowledge.'

**Abstract:** Consumers’ perceptual images (PI) of products are multi-dimensional. Similarly, the stimulation of emotions by
product is the result of the combined effect of multi-dimensional modeling features(MMF). However, in traditional Kansei 
engineering(TKE), most studies often use the one-dimensional variable expression model (OVEM) with only shape, color, or 
texture, and optimize product form based on a single PI objective. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method for 
deconstructing and multi-objective optimization of product morphological features based on a multi-dimensional variable expression model (MVEM). Firstly, the electric shaver is taken as a case, and the MMF library is constructed by deconstructing 
the morphological features of products from three levels: “appearance attributes,” “interaction attributes” and “cultural attributes.” Extract key design variables corresponding to multi-dimensional image needs(MIN) from the MMF library using link 
relative method. Then construct the prediction model of MIN separately using back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and 
it’s embedded in the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-Ⅱ (NSGA-Ⅱ) to derive the Pareto optimal solution, which finally 
resulted in layouts of holistic multidimensional(HM) in Kansei engineering (KE). The research results demonstrate that the 
proposed construction process and methodology of HM are feasible and effective, with significant guidance and practical application value.

## The Story Behind the Research: A Personal Note
This article was likely the penultimate one I wrote and marked my first attempt at submitting to an SCI journal. Prior to this, I had completed roughly seven papers. My motivation at the time was an eager desire for a higher-quality paper in preparation for my Ph.D. studies, prompting me to set my sights on the SCI. The primary challenge of submitting to an SCI journal is selecting the right one. Unlike Chinese journals, which are often more targeted, SCI journals can be broader in scope. Given that industrial design is an interdisciplinary field with a wide range of possibilities, the choices are even more diverse. Consequently, I spent a significant amount of time in the preparatory phase gathering information about SCI journals. My method, as usual, was to read literature, specifically foreign literature in the field of affective engineering. On one hand, I could identify and compile the journals where existing affective engineering papers were published; on the other, reading these papers provided insights into potential innovative research angles. After extensive accumulation, I initially organized a list of nearly 30 SCI journals from relevant fields. After weighing various factors, including acceptance rates, the number of published articles in the affective engineering field, and publication fees, I eventually settled on the Journal of Intelligent & Fuzzy Systems as my target journal. I then embarked on selecting a topic and began the writing process. Unsurprisingly, the paper was rejected. This bold attempt ended in failure. From my reading, I understood deeply that SCI journals emphasize significant academic contributions, an area where my paper fell short. It's clear my writing level still has room for improvement. However, this experience mirrored my first submission to the Packaging Engineering journal. Since this article was a result of my earnest effort, even if I could foresee potential setbacks, I would still choose to make the attempt. Only by trying and receiving feedback can I genuinely recognize my shortcomings. These invaluable learning experiences will form the foundation for my future improvements.
