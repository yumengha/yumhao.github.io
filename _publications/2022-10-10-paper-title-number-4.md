excerpt: 'This paper is actually the second to last article I have written so far. It is also the first time I have attempted to write an article with the goal of being included in the SCI. This bold attempt was made after I had written a considerable number of papers on Kansei Engineering and Neural Networks, and I believed that I had a certain mastery of the relevant knowledge.'

**Abstract:** Consumers’ perceptual images (PI) of products are multi-dimensional. Similarly, the stimulation of emotions by
product is the result of the combined effect of multi-dimensional modeling features(MMF). However, in traditional Kansei 
engineering(TKE), most studies often use the one-dimensional variable expression model (OVEM) with only shape, color, or 
texture, and optimize product form based on a single PI objective. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method for 
deconstructing and multi-objective optimization of product morphological features based on a multi-dimensional variable expression model (MVEM). Firstly, the electric shaver is taken as a case, and the MMF library is constructed by deconstructing 
the morphological features of products from three levels: “appearance attributes,” “interaction attributes” and “cultural attributes.” Extract key design variables corresponding to multi-dimensional image needs(MIN) from the MMF library using link 
relative method. Then construct the prediction model of MIN separately using back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and 
it’s embedded in the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-Ⅱ (NSGA-Ⅱ) to derive the Pareto optimal solution, which finally 
resulted in layouts of holistic multidimensional(HM) in Kansei engineering (KE). The research results demonstrate that the 
proposed construction process and methodology of HM are feasible and effective, with significant guidance and practical application value.
