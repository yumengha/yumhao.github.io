**Abstract:** With the growth of new energy vehicles, competition in the auto industry is fierce.
Automotive brands must continuously seek innovative design solutions to secure their market 
position. Which BEVs offer more design freedom, particularly in interior design, as they don't 
require considerations for fuel engines and related components. However, with the arrival of 
the era of personalized consumption, what kind of design exploration can be accepted by 
consumers is still under study. Therefore, this research uses Kansei engineering theory to study 
the center console of BEVs, collect and select representative images sample and perceptual 
vocabulary of BEV center console, counts the mean value of users’ perceptual evaluation 
through market research, establishes the response matrix of design elements based on 
quantitative theory Ⅰ, and uses multiple linear regression analysis to obtain the influence 
relationship between each design element and users’ perceptual imagery, so as to evaluate 
innovative design results of the BEV center console. The research results indicate that different 
center console design elements have a significant difference in the degree of influence on user 
sensory imagery. The connection transition method between the center console and armrest box 
has a significant impact on the user’s perception of the simplicity. The usage method of the 
center screen and the color matching will have a significant impact on its futuristic.
