**Abstract:** **Objective** Design a community social platform suitable for the elderly, alleviate the loneliness of the empty -nest elderly in the 
home-based elderly care service, and help the construction of the community intelligent elderly care platform.
**Methods** We obtained the target user requirements through research, organized the requirements in three aspects: basic func￾tions, interaction methods, and modeling structure, conducted qualitative analysis of user requirements usi ng the Kano model, 
constructed the requirement evaluation index system of community connected products for the elderly, and conducted quanti￾tative analysis of the requirement evaluation index system through AHP hierarchical analysis to obtain the weights of each 
requirement index of community connected products for the elderly.
**Results** Based on the results of the qualitative and quantitative analysis, the design of the community connected products for 
the elderly was completed. 
**Conclusion** The elderly are more concerned about the basic functions and human-machine attributes of the community con￾nected products, and the design of the community connected products for the elderly should focus on improving the ease of 
use of the products for the elderly, and the research provides new ideas and references for the design and development of 
smart pension products in the context of smart pension.  
**Keywords:** community interconnection; user needs; Kano model; hierarchical analysis

## The Story Behind the Research: A Personal Note
This article was the first I wrote after deciding to pursue a Ph.D. I began preparations at the start of the second year of my master's program. The genesis of this effort can be traced back to the summer of my first year. My advisor, in an effort to encourage us to read more literature during the summer, formulated a study plan for us. We started by reading literature about design methods and periodically reported our progress in understanding these methods. My first learning target was the Kano model, which subsequently paved the way for my exploration into various design methods such as AHP, QFD, and TRIZ. After several presentations and revisions, my grasp of the theoretical content and application methods of the Kano model received approval from my advisor. He suggested that I was ready to write an article employing it. After much consideration, the Kano model, being the first design method I mastered, was successfully incorporated into my first paper. Initially, I submitted this article to the Packaging Engineering journal, and, as expected, it was rejected. The feedback from the reviewers was piercing, mainly pointing out inadequacies between the problem I intended to solve and the methods I used. This first submission experience provided immense growth and prompted deep reflection on what constitutes a quality academic paper. Thanks to this, the quality of my second article improved significantly and was successfully accepted by the Packaging Engineering journal. With the feedback received, I revised the first paper and subsequently successfully submitted it to a design journal.
