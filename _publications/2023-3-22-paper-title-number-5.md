**Abstract:** **Objective** Design a community social platform suitable for the elderly, alleviate the loneliness of the empty -nest elderly in the 
home-based elderly care service, and help the construction of the community intelligent elderly care platform.
**Methods** We obtained the target user requirements through research, organized the requirements in three aspects: basic func￾tions, interaction methods, and modeling structure, conducted qualitative analysis of user requirements usi ng the Kano model, 
constructed the requirement evaluation index system of community connected products for the elderly, and conducted quanti￾tative analysis of the requirement evaluation index system through AHP hierarchical analysis to obtain the weights of each 
requirement index of community connected products for the elderly.
**Results** Based on the results of the qualitative and quantitative analysis, the design of the community connected products for 
the elderly was completed. 
**Conclusion** The elderly are more concerned about the basic functions and human-machine attributes of the community con￾nected products, and the design of the community connected products for the elderly should focus on improving the ease of 
use of the products for the elderly, and the research provides new ideas and references for the design and development of 
smart pension products in the context of smart pension.
