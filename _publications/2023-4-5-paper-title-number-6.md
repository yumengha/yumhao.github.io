**Abstract:** **Objective** A visual analysis of the research trend of aging-friendly product design at home and abroad in the past two decades 
is presented to provide reference for the innovation of aging product design in the context of population aging.
**Methods** Based on CNKI database and WOS core collection database, we collected literature data using relevant search for￾mula, and applied CiteSpace and VOSviewer to process the collected literature data and analyze the annual publication vol￾ume, research institutions, authors, as well as source journals and countries of literature , keyword co-occurrence mapping of 
the literature was conducted to analyze the research hotspots in the field of aging-friendly product design.
**Results** Get the hot spots and trends of aging product design research at home and abroad in the past two decades.
**Conclusion** As one of the special groups in society, the elderly are gradually receiving more attention, and the research on 
product design for the elderly is generally on the rise, among which, the United States, China and the United Kingdom are the 
main positions of research in this field, with domestic research mainly focusing on product design practice and foreign re￾search mainly on user research for the elderly, strengthening international academic exchange and cooperation is conducive to 
the overall development of aging-friendly product design research.
**Keywords:** Aging-friendly design; elderly; product design; CiteSpace; VOSviewer
