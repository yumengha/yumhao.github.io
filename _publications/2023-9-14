excerpt: 'As you can see, some of these papers have been successfully accepted, while others have not yet been officially accepted due to various reasons and time constraints.Nevertheless, I have chosen to display them all because I believe each one represents the fruit of my hard work. They are the products of tireless effort, typed out one word at a time.I hope they can be seen by the professors. Through these works, I want the professors to see the efforts I've made over the past year and to recognize that I have indeed done everything within my capacity to achieve my goals.'
