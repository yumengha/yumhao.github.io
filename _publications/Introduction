This page contains the work I have accomplished over the past year since I began preparing for my doctoral examination at the start of my second year of graduate studies.  
As you can see, some of these papers have been successfully accepted, while others have not yet been officially accepted due to various reasons and time constraints.  
**Nevertheless**, I have chosen to display them all because I believe each one represents the fruit of my hard work. They are the products of tireless effort, 
typed out one word at a time.I hope they can be seen by the professors. Through these 
works, I want the professors to see the efforts I've made over the past year and to 
recognize that I have indeed done everything within my capacity to achieve my goals.
